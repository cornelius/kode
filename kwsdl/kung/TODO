Work needed on kung:

Work needed on kschemawidgets to be useful for WSGUI editor:
- qt-only mode, via #ifdef or some other magic
  (why oh why does kdeui abort if e.g. KDatePicker is used in a qApp?)
  (could lead into general extensibility framework for new type->widget mappings!)
- guaranteed fallback to QLineEdit
- support for Qt's «text» property in all widgets, or proxy method from editor
  (e.g. qcheckbox already has it, kintspinbox doesn't!)
- look into XSD<->QVariant type compatibility, add semantics for file, image, ...?
  (extension to GUIDD or KXForms UGH needed)
