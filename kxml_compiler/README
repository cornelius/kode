This directory contains the sources for kxml_compiler, a tool, which generates
C++ code from XML descriptions, either RelaxNG or W3C schemas, or an example XML
file.

The tests directory contains some unit tests. Please run them by setting
KDE4_BUILD_TESTS to ON, and running "make test" after the make to create the
kxml_compiler executable.
